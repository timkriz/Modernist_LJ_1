The vast central section of the square has hosted numerous historic events, including the declaration of Slovenia’s independence on 25 June 1991. The square is lined by a number of monuments from the period of socialist Yugoslavia.

    "Desription_detail":" Like many other neighbourhoods\nin Ljubljana, the construction of BS 3 was never\ncompleted in full. Despite this fact, however, it\nboasts many interesting features that contribute to\nits special character. According to the initial design,\nthere should have been two enormous apartment\nblocks constructed on its eastern border. Instead\nthese were replaced with tower blocks with pointed\ncaps at the top, which are the identifying feature of\nthe neighbourhood today. Tower blocks are posi- tioned in two clusters along Vojkova Street, while the\ninterior core of the neighbourhood evolves into long\nrows of low-rise apartment buildings with access\nroads running underneath. The friendly character\nof the neighbourhood is accentuated by generous\noutdoor spaces – green areas, parks, squares,\nalleys and footpaths. They are designed as green\nalleys separating apartments from each other, with\nplaygrounds, rest areas and recreation islands lined\nup along them.",
